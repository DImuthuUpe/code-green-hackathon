#Puppy-Earth
####A project started by team [CodeGreen](https://github.com/koding/global.hackathon/blob/master/Teams/CodeGreen/ABOUT.md) for [Koding](https://koding.com/)'s First Global Virtual Hackathon

###Description
This is an application that provides information about the global warming and invites the user to take initiative in order to reduce carbon emissions to the environment, which is the primary cause of global warming. The application is a global [Tamagotchi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamagotchi) where the digital pet represents the planet earth and tracks when users do something 'green' to keep the earth healthy. To help the user in doing their part, the application allows to check out how much GHG their way of living contributes annually, then helps to set goals and measure progress. The app is an amazing source of information which helps to discover good habits, revealing real data that we never imagined. In addition, when you get a negative score the application assigns you a task that allows you to take an action to help the environment. The application takes advantage of two 'superheroic' frameworks (AngularJS/Ionic) that allow to run the same code in a web browser or package as an App and publish with AppStore/PlayStore without any changes. The registration does not require any sensitive information, and animations and screen transitions contribute to an easy and comfortable user experience.
