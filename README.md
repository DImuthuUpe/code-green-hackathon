###Description
This is an application that provides information about the global warming and invites the user to take initiative in order to reduce carbon emissions to the environment, which is the primary cause of global warming. The application is a global [Tamagotchi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamagotchi) where the digital pet represents the planet earth and tracks when users do something 'green' to keep the earth healthy. To help the user in doing their part, the application allows to check out how much GHG their way of living contributes annually, then helps to set goals and measure progress.
